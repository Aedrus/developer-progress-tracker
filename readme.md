# Developer Progress Tracker

## Table of Contents
[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Introduction
This simple tracker outlines a list of milestones related to my development journey. The goal is to clear out a road from where my journey began and where it is going. It will also list accomplishments that I can reference in the future. It will cover a range of development topics and anything related to the process of developing websites and apps (design):
* __Technologies/Skills Covered__ - Broken into levels of current proficiency.
* __Studied Topics__ - Showing date completed and source of learning + certificates.
* __Goals & Future Plans__ - Things I'd like to learn next.

This tracker is based on the [learning tracker](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker) by Syknapse, which I recommend checking out.
